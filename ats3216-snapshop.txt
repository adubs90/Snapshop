Assignment Overview

Snapshop was an assignment that had learn to implement a GUI based off of some given classes.
Tons of new keywords were learned by me in this assignment. To name  a few: JFrame, JPanel, 
JButton, JFileChooser, BorderLayout, FlowLayout, JLabel, ActionListener, WindowEvent, 
ActionEvent, and JOptionPane. We were to display a gui with filter buttons, load an image, 
use those filter buttons to alter the image in various ways. 


Technical Impression

This assignment provided me with a very very big challenge in that I have never worked with
GUI building or Swing before. It took a lot of messing around to understand what each Swing
element did and how they interact with eachother. By far the two most difficult parts in my
opinion, was the implementation of the filter buttons. Understanding how to form the buttons
so that they could be "filtered" was a big big challenge, and took many trials and failures. 
The other difficult part (as you wil see in my program) is trying to get the image to save to 
a file. I don't know if it was that I didn't understand how to implement the given save() 
method correctly, or what the problem was, but I could not get it to function properly without
it giving me a FileNotFoundException. I also could not get the "Static Variable Definition in 
wrong order." error to go away. I tried rearranging the 'private' 'static' and 'final' around
but that didn't seem to help, so im not entirely sure what it is asking.
